	<h1>Quantum Mechanics</h1>
	<h2>Beginnner's Guide</h2>
	<p>
		Okay, I wrote this exxplaination specific to you ( or a football player, to be precise). At the end, we can guarantee you ( not 100 percent, for sure ) that you will understand the very basics of Quantum Mechanics, more like a beginner's manual. This is more like telling a newbie that football is a game where you kick a football. As you a professional player ( respect ), you know that it is a lot more complicated and interesting than that. So we are treating you as a newbie in the quantum field now ( not that I am any professional ). Let's get into it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		The first thing about quantum world is that everything come in definite quantities. Like your football team will have say 11 or 12 players but never 11.34 or 9.5 players ( player with no leg is useless or even no skills ).

		Energy comes in packets, so does your mass and many fundamental quantities. You might have learned about atoms in your school. There is a nucleus in between and electrons orbiting in orbits like planets around the Sun. 
	</p>

		You have seen that electrons orbit in definite orbits. There is no electron hanging around in between two consecutive orbits. These orbits have value that are integral multiples of a lowest value. Think of it as a ladder - it has steps at a certain interval and you can only step on those steps. If you put your legs in-between two steps, it wont help you go up or down and you would indefinitely land on the lower step. Same is the case.
	</p>

		Now let us see what a particle actually is. Take your footall ground/ field ( whatever you prefer ) which is nothing but a flat ground or a field. We will consider value of any object on the field as its height from ground ( simple as that ). When the ground is empty ( totally ) then the value at every point is the lowest but not zero ( considering the small uneveness of the ground ). As a kicker ( you know what I mean! ) you can only kick objects whose value is higher than the lowest ( that's easy to unserstand ) and every such object is nothing but a particle of your footall field. Now since, any object other than football ( as far as I know, just consider it even if I am wrong ) is not allowed, we have a default value for a particle as footballs have a fixed standard dimension ( maybe, I have no idea, just consider it ). We are not treating you players as particles as you have varying heights. 
	</p>

		For example, consider an island, fully plain with very little unevenness. Let us take the lowest value of this island as the height of an elevation from sea level. Due to little unevenness the 'value' is almost same throughout the island. Now when we place a mountain, its 'value' will be quite high than the ususal. When you observe this island from a certain height ( a height from where the entire island would fit in your field of vision ) you observe a plain ground with a slight bump at the location of the mountain. This mountain is treated as our particle and the island as the field with which it is associated with. Every single particle is believed to be in such form, though these fields aren't anything like the island. But you get the point.

		Here comes the weird part - the reason why quantum mechanics is the weirdest theory of all. Consider a penalty kick ( I might get this wrong, I am a complete nobody in football ). Suppose the keeper is standing in middle of the goal-area ( whatever you call it ) and you are the kicker ( all the best! ). There are regions in the goal-area where you will try to hit, like at the ends and you would difinitely avoid hitting near the keeper ( unless you have some amazing strategy, let us play simple for now ). So there are regions in the goal-area where probability of ball being hit is high while some regions have low probablity. The spectators sitting there will have no idea which one it will be. They are uncertain about it. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<p>
		They will see the future position of the ball as a probability spread across a certain region. The ball is now treated as a wave which consists all possible future positions of the ball. Only when you kick the ball is when it will take any one of the values. This phenomenon is called Quantum Superposition ( you get it - SUPER-position ). In this way, every particle can be treated as a wave - also called the Dual Nature of Matter. See, pretty simple, isn't it?!.
	</p>
	<br><br>

		On our scale everything has definite properties. Like a football will be round and bouncy ( unless you puncture it ). A stone will be hard and you will remain awesome!. But in quantum world ( or at the scale of electrons ), every particle has all its properties that are in the probability of states like the earlier condition. Only when we make measurements is when it gives us one values. Like if you were a quantum particle, you would be like awesome at times and might even be a total jerk like my sister at times, there would be a chance. I would probably punch you if you behaved like the latter ( just joking ). 
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<p>
		Now if some spectator concentrates on the hitting spot of the ball, he might lose information of which trick you used to kick, provided your kick was too fast which is the case with quantum particles which move at near light-speeds. The quantum particles have all the properties in a fuzzy probability of values and if you try to measure one value precisely, then you lose information of other property which is frustrating.
	</p>

		All this tells that the Universe is built on a lot of randomness. The reason if God exists would be a drunken bastard to leave the Universe in such a random state. Many truely random events have made humans possible and also made them total jerks they are today. When you dig deep, the idea of God is silly. Our Universe is like a dice game and its players are the four fundamental forces of Nature.

		If you believe in a supernaturnal force, there exists one - The Great Unified Force which caused the Big Bang ( the birth of the Universe ). Something pushed the infant Universe and it bursted into this ginormous beauty you see today. Every person and animal who ever lived, is living or will live has experienced it.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are extended hands of the Universe, like players on this field of Universe and life is a game. The Universe doesn't need a God, it is powerful on its own.

		I hope that went well, I made this especially for you. If you feel it utter bullshit, feel free to tell me frankly as it would help me to improve. Stay Curious.
